## Installation

To install this package from GitHub, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/apwheele/crimepy.git
```

For now, I would suggest installing editable, since it is in a very early stage. E.g.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apwheele/crimepy.git
cd ./crimpy
pip install -e .
```

## Examples

See the notebooks folder for example analyses:
